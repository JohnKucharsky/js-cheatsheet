# Javascript Cheatsheets

Welcome to **JS Cheatsheets** ‚Äì a comprehensive collection of **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** cheatsheets, code snippets, and interactive challenges.
Explore practical examples covering syntax, algorithms, system design, and real-world coding problems ‚Äî perfect for daily practice, interview preparation, or leveling up your **JS/TS** skills, all demonstrated with clear, runnable code snippets.

> This resource is **complementary** to excellent official documentation and learning platforms like [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/), and [react.dev](https://react.dev/).
> If you're just starting out, we highly recommend reading those resources **first** to build a solid foundation.
> However, you can also begin with **JS Cheatsheets** to explore examples in action, reinforce what you learn, or quickly reference key concepts while coding.
