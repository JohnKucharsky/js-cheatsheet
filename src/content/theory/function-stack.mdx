## Function Stack

The **call stack** is a critical concept in JavaScript that keeps track of function calls. When a function is called,
it is "pushed" onto the stack. Once the function finishes execution, it is "popped" off the stack. This stack-based approach
is essential for understanding recursion and function execution order in JavaScript.

In the **forward phase**, the function calls accumulate as the recursion continues, with each new function invocation pushing
itself onto the stack. In the **backward phase**, as functions start to return, they unwind and are popped from the stack, completing their execution.

This behavior is demonstrated in the following example, where `foo` is called recursively until it hits the base case,
then the stack is unwound as each function completes.

### Forward Phase (Pushing):
1. Call `foo(2)` -> Stack: `[foo(2)]`.
2. Call `foo(1)` -> Stack: `[foo(2), foo(1)]`.
3. Call `foo(0)` -> Stack: `[foo(2), foo(1), foo(0)]`.
4. Call `foo(-1)` -> Stack: `[foo(2), foo(1), foo(0), foo(-1)]`.

### Backward Phase (Unwinding):
1. Return from `foo(-1)` -> Stack: `[foo(2), foo(1), foo(0)]`.
2. Complete `foo(0)` -> Stack: `[foo(2), foo(1)]`.
3. Complete `foo(1)` -> Stack: `[foo(2)]`.
4. Complete `foo(2)` -> Stack: `[]`.

```js
function foo(i) {
  if (i < 0) {
    return;
  }
  console.log(`begin: ${i}`);
  foo(i - 1);
  console.log(`end: ${i}`);
}
foo(2);

// begin: 2
// begin: 1
// begin: 0
// end: 0
// end: 1
// end: 2
```
