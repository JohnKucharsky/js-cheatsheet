## intersection

The [`_.intersection()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#intersection) method
computes the intersection of two or more arrays. It returns a new array containing the
elements that are present in all provided arrays.

This custom implementation compares two arrays by converting them to `Set` objects for
efficient lookup and finding the common elements between them.

```js
const intersection = function (nums1, nums2) {
  const set1 = new Set(nums1);
  const set2 = new Set(nums2);
  const result = [];

  for (const nums of set2) {
    if (set1.has(nums)) {
      result.push(nums);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

console.log(intersection([2, 1], [2, 3])); // [ 2 ]
```
