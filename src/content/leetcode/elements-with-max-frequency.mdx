## count elements with maximum frequency

Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all
have the maximum frequency. The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences
of that element in the array.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = `[1,2,2,3,1,4]`
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = `[1,2,3,4,5]`
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5

```typescript
function maxFrequencyElements(nums: number[]) {
  const freqCounter = new Map();

  let maxFrequency = 1;

  // Iterate through the array and update the frequency of each number
  for (const num of nums) {
    freqCounter.set(num, (freqCounter.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    maxFrequency = Math.max(
      maxFrequency,
      freqCounter.get(num),
    );
  }

  let total = 0;

  for (const freq of freqCounter.values()) {
    if (freq === maxFrequency) {
      total = total + freq;
    }
  }

  return total;
}

console.log(maxFrequencyElements([1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4])); // 4
console.log(maxFrequencyElements([1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4])); // 3
console.log(maxFrequencyElements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // 5
```
