## Promise.any

Similar to `Promise.race`, but waits only for the first fulfilled promise and gets its result.
If all the given promises are rejected, then the returned promise is rejected with
[`AggregateError`](mdn:js/AggregateError) - a special error object that stores all promise
errors in its `errors` property.

```js
Promise.customAny = function (promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const errors = [];
    let remaining = promises.length;

    if (remaining === 0) {
      return reject(new AggregateError([], "All promises were rejected"));
    }

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(resolve)
        .catch((error) => {
          errors[index] = error;
          remaining -= 1;
          if (remaining === 0) {
            reject(new AggregateError(errors, "All promises were rejected"));
          }
        });
    });
  });
};

const promise1 = Promise.reject(0);
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "quick"));
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, "slow"));

const promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];

Promise.customAny(promises).then((value) => console.log(value)); // quick
```
