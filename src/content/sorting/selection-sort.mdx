## selection sort

The [`selectionSort()`](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_selectionsort.php) algorithm sorts an
array by repeatedly finding the smallest element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the element at
the current position. It iterates through the array, and in each iteration, selects the smallest element from
the remaining unsorted portion and moves it to its correct position.

This custom implementation demonstrates the selection sort algorithm by scanning the array for the smallest element
and swapping it to the front, progressively moving through the array.

```js
const selectionSort = (arr) => {
  const n = arr.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    let minIndex = i;

    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
        minIndex = j;
      }
    }

    const minValue = arr.splice(minIndex, 1)[0];
    arr.splice(i, 0, minValue);
  }
};

const myArray = [64, 34, 25, 5, 22, 11, 90, 12];
selectionSort(myArray);
console.log(myArray);
// [ 5, 11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90 ]
```
