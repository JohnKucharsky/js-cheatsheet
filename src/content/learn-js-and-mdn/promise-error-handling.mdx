## Promise Error Handling

These examples show how to handle errors in promise chains using `.catch()`.
They demonstrate how synchronous errors thrown during the executor function are
automatically caught, while asynchronous errors (e.g., in `setTimeout`)
are **not** — unless they're wrapped in a `try...catch` or returned from a rejected promise.

Understanding where and when errors can be caught is key to building reliable async flows.

```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
})
  .catch(function (error) {
    if (error instanceof URIError) {
      // handle it
    } else {
      console.log("Can't handle such error");

      throw error;
      // throwing this or another error jumps to the next catch
    }
  })
  .then(function () {
    /* doesn't run here */
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(`The unknown error has occurred: ${error.message}`);
    // don't return anything => execution goes the normal way
  });

// Can't handle such error
// The unknown error has occurred: Whoops!
```

### ⚠️ Synchronous vs Asynchronous Errors in Promises

Promises automatically catch **synchronous errors** thrown inside the executor.
However, errors thrown **asynchronously** (e.g., inside `setTimeout`) are not
caught unless explicitly wrapped in a rejecting `Promise` or a `try...catch` block inside async functions.

```js
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).catch((e) => console.error(e.message)); // Whoops!

// There’s an “implicit try..catch” around the function code.
// So all synchronous errors are handled.
// But here the error is generated not while the executor is
// running, but later. So the promise can’t handle it.

new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    throw new Error("Whoops!");
  }, 1000);
}).catch(console.error); // unhandled error ...
```
