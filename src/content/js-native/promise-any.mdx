## Promise.any

The [`Promise.any()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any)
method returns a promise that **fulfills as soon as any of the input promises is fulfilled**.
If **all** promises reject, it rejects with an [`AggregateError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AggregateError)
containing all rejection reasons.

This example demonstrates a custom implementation of `Promise.any()` that resolves with the first successful result or throws an aggregate error if none succeed.


```js
Promise.customAny = function (promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const errors = [];
    let remaining = promises.length;

    if (remaining === 0) {
      return reject(new AggregateError([], "All promises were rejected"));
    }

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(resolve)
        .catch((error) => {
          errors[index] = error;
          remaining -= 1;
          if (remaining === 0) {
            reject(new AggregateError(errors, "All promises were rejected"));
          }
        });
    });
  });
};

const promise1 = Promise.reject(0);
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "quick"));
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, "slow"));

const promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];

Promise.customAny(promises).then((value) => console.log(value)); // quick
```
