## Promise.race

The [`Promise.race()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race)
method returns a promise that **settles as soon as the first input promise settles** â€” whether it fulfills or rejects.
This makes it useful when you're interested only in the fastest outcome, regardless of its result.

This example includes a custom implementation of `Promise.race()` that resolves or rejects based on whichever promise finishes first.

```js
Promise.customRace = function (promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    for (const promise of promises) {
      Promise.resolve(promise).then(resolve, reject);
    }
  });
};

Promise.customRace([
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000)),
  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Whoops!")), 2000),
  ),
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 3000)),
]).then(console.log); // 1
```
