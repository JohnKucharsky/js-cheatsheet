## innerJoin

Implements a basic [`innerJoin`](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#innerJoin) function for
arrays â€” similar to SQL inner joins. This method takes a `predicate`, a list of `records`, and a list of `ids`.
It returns all records where the predicate returns true for at least one ID.

This approach is helpful for:
- Matching entities across two datasets
- Resolving references between relational data
- Filtering records based on foreign key relations

The example joins musician records by matching their `id` with an array of selected IDs.

```js
function innerJoin(predicate, records, ids) {
  return records.filter((record) => ids.some((id) => predicate(record, id)));
}

const result = innerJoin(
  (record, id) => record.id === id,
  [
    { id: 824, name: "Richie Furay" },
    { id: 956, name: "Dewey Martin" },
    { id: 313, name: "Bruce Palmer" },
    { id: 456, name: "Stephen Stills" },
    { id: 177, name: "Neil Young" },
  ],
  [177, 456, 999],
);

console.log(result);
// [{id: 456, name: 'Stephen Stills'}, {id: 177, name: 'Neil Young'}]
```
